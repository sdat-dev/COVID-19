The central theme of submitted projects must be the quantitative or computational understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics. The intent is discovery of principles of infectious disease transmission and testing mathematical or computational models that elucidate infectious disease systems. Projects should be broad, interdisciplinary efforts that go beyond the scope of typical studies. They should focus on the determinants and interactions of transmission among humans, non-human animals, and/or plants. This includes, for example, the spread of pathogens; the influence of environmental factors such as climate; the population dynamics and genetics of reservoir species or hosts; the feedback between ecological transmission and evolutionary dynamics; and the cultural, social, behavioral, and economic dimensions of pathogen transmission. Research may be on zoonotic, environmentally-borne, vector-borne, or enteric pathogens of either terrestrial or aquatic systems and organisms, including diseases of animals and plants, at any scale from specific pathogens to inclusive environmental systems. Proposals for research on disease systems of public health concern to developing countries are strongly encouraged, as are disease systems of concern in agricultural systems. Investigators are encouraged to develop the appropriate multidisciplinary team, including for example, anthropologists, modelers, ecologists, bioinformaticians, genomics researchers, social scientists, economists, oceanographers, mathematical scientists, epidemiologists, evolutionary biologists, entomologists, parasitologists, microbiologists, bacteriologists, virologists, pathologists or veterinarians, with the goal of integrating knowledge across disciplines to enhance our ability to predict and control infectious diseases. The goal of the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) program is to support important and innovative research on the ecological, evolutionary, and socio-ecological principles that influence the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. The program's focus is on the discovery of general principles and processes and on building and testing models that elucidate these principles. Projects must address the quantitative or computational understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics. Research in EEID is expected to be an interdisciplinary effort that goes beyond the scope of typical studies funded by the standing programs of the partner agencies. Projects should bring together such areas as anthropology, bioinformatics, computational science, ecology, economics, epidemiology, evolution, food science, genomics, geography, global health, mathematics, medicine, microbiology, oceanography, plant science, population biology, sociology, physical environmental sciences, systems science, and veterinary medicine. Research within EEID is expected to generate rigorously characterized and tested models that are of value to the scientific community, but also may be useful in decision making. The history of the EEID program has shown that the most competitive proposals are those that advance broad, conceptual knowledge that reaches beyond the specific system under study and that may be useful for understanding public, agricultural or ecosystem health, natural resource use and wildlife management, and/or economic development. Such proposals are typically interdisciplinary in their approach and/or the nature of the question(s) being addressed.","updateddate":"5/13/20"},{"title":"Dear Colleague Letter: Request for SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposals Addressing COVID-19","agency":"Directorate for Engineering/NSF","logo":"assets//logos//nsf.png","category":"NSF","dueDate":"Continuous Submission","fundingLevel":"Not Specified","website":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20065/nsf20065.jsp","description":"The Division of Innovation and Industrial Partnerships (IIP) of the Engineering Directorate invites US-based small businesses to submit Phase I proposals focused on the development and deployment of new technologies, products, processes, and services with the potential to positively impact the nation’s and world’s ability to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.

The Trump Administration has prioritized the use of high performance computing to solve critical national challenges. In March 2020, President Donald J. Trump announced the launch of the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium to provide COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world’s most powerful high performance computing resources that can significantly advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. This unique public-private consortium - spearheaded by the White House, DOE, and IBM - includes government, industry, and academic leaders. For additional information about the COVID-19 High Performance Computer Consortium, including information about how to submit a proposal for that program please follow the above link. Strengthening the competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing sector is a top priority for the Trump Administration and will be critical to America’s economic recovery,” said Alex Fitzsimmons, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency. “DOE’s High Performance Computing for Manufacturing program allows industry to access advanced computing resources within the DOE National Laboratories to address key manufacturing challenges.” This manufacturing program is one component of the High Performance Computing for Energy Innovation (HPC4EI) initiative, which is led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. HPC4EI conducts two regular solicitations annually, one in the fall and one in the spring. The spring solicitation will target qualified industry partners to participate in short-term, collaborative projects with DOE National Laboratories that address key manufacturing challenges by applying modeling, simulation, and data analysis. The solicitation will encourage applicants to partner with universities and non-profit organizations located within federally designated Opportunity Zones and/or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Eligibility for the program is limited to entities that manufacture products or operate systems in the U.S. for commercial applications and organizations that support them. Selected projects will be awarded up to $300,000 to support computing cycles and work performed by DOE National Laboratories, universities, and non-profit partners. All DOE National Laboratories are eligible to participate. The industry partner must provide a participant contribution of at least 20% of the total project funding. DOE’s Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO), within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, is the primary sponsor of the High Performance Computing for Manufacturing program. AMO partners with private and public stakeholders to advance innovation in U.S. manufacturing and promote American economic growth and energy security.

The National Biodefense Strategy is.the nation’s plan for ensuring that the country is prepared for, responding to, and recovering from health incidents such as these. As a partner in the Strategy, the Department of Energy (DOE) contributes science and technology to support these efforts. This is not the first emerging infectious disease event that the world will face, nor will it be the last I am asking for your ideas about how DOE and the National Labs might contribute resources to help address COVID-19 through science and technology efforts and collaborations. Through its user facilities, computational power, and enabling infrastructure, DOE has unique capabilities that the scientific community may leverage for the COVID-19 response and recovery. DOE does not provide medical and clinical work; instead, the Department’s mission complements the efforts of the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and other Federal partners by helping to understand the scientific phenomena contributing to COVID-19, from the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease, to models that can mimic its spread. DOE supports significant biologically focused facilities and resources, including the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC), Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory (EMSL), and DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase ). These and other DOE resources may be used for many studies, such as: Developing high-throughput multiplex technologies to characterize virus-host interactions, determine phage resistance mechanisms in nature, identify the degree of specificity for each bacterial resistance mechanisms across diverse phage types, and understand the coevolution of hosts and their phages, which can ultimately be used to design better phage therapeutic treatments and tools for precision microbiome engmeenng; Improved modeling for understanding natural viral populations and persistence in the environment, as well as predictive modeling for viral stability and evolution in changing environmental conditions; Understanding virus-microbiome community composition, function, and evolution; Synthetic biology of key target viral proteins to rapidly develop improved vaccines or therapeutics; and • Synthetic biology to construct viral genome variants and test viral stability, persistence, and resilience in the environment. Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) at the DOE National Labs can provide high resolution molecular structure of virus particles and their interactions with other macromolecules including antibodies and drug candidates at cryogenic temperatures. These instruments provide another window to characterize viruses and provide insights on treatment paths. Protein characterization at DOE’s light sources and neutron sources can yield key insights into the relationship between structure and function of the proteins comprising viruses. Macromolecular crystallography (MX) provides the positions to atomic resolution of a protein’s atoms, as well as the atoms of a bound drug or drug fragment that has been infused into the protein crystal for screening potential pharmaceuticals. This critical information can guide development of a potent drug with minimal side effects. MX can also provide the evolution of structures with time to understand drug binding or metabolism. X-ray solution scattering can provide rapid screening of drug fragment libraries to detect binding to proteins. Fragments that bind and cause protein conformational change are targets for further investigated at high resolution with MX. DOE’s user facilities also have special capabilities for characterization of small (nanometers in size) crystals. The Nanoscale Science Research Centers, located at five of the National Laboratories, could be valuable resources for developing intrinsically antiviral surfaces and materials for COVID-19 and other viruses. Supercomputing facilities at DOE offer some of the most powerful resources for scientific computing in the world. The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), and National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) may be used for modeling and simulation coupled with machine and deep learning techniques to study a range of areas, including examining underlying protein structure, classifying the evolution of the virus, understanding mutation, uncovering important differences and similarities with the 2002-2003 SARS virus, searching for potential vaccine and antiviral compounds, and simulating the spread of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of countermeasure options.

In addition to investigating the current pandemic, it is important to identify fundamental research questions that produce generalizable scientific findings. The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) is therefore issuing a call for a multidisciplinary funding initiative. Funding is available for projects addressing the prevention, early detection, containment and investigation of the causes, impacts and management of epidemics and pandemics, taking the example of SARS-CoV-2 and other microorganisms and viruses that are pathogenic to humans. This includes, for example, the investigation of the challenges and effects of an epidemic or pandemic and of measures taken for healthcare systems; psychological, social and cultural factors in the emergence, spread and treatment of epidemics and pandemics and the legal and ethical implications; the impacts on global and regional economic development, production and value creation chains, logistics, transport and communication; fundamental biological and medical aspects of a pathogen and the associated symptoms, as well as therapeutic methods or preventive measures in combination with one or more of the above topic areas. The call is primarily aimed at multidisciplinary research projects. Proposals will also be considered for projects designed to gather and record basic data on the current epidemic and current countermeasures, which can serve as the basis for future retrospective analyses.

Masks currently in use such as N95 masks were designed, developed, and tested to block larger particles and are not as effective against these smaller new respiratory infectious viruses.

In the case of clinical care, areas of specific importance include disease prevention, diagnosis and screening, and patient care and disease management.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to galvanize medical robot technologies, as they play an increasingly major role in combating contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nThis new challenge is aimed at entries that could offer solutions as part of a multi-faceted response to this and future global pandemics.

COVID-19 now represents a global emergency. Development and testing of a vaccine will take at least a year and it may be two years before there is good protection across the most vulnerable groups. There is a clear need for new treatments that will reduce the mortality rate while we wait for a vaccine. Development of novel molecules is not thought to be realistic in the timeframe needed to impact upon this pandemic, so the focus for this call is on repurposing already available drugs (including biologics) or those in late stages of development. LifeArc is calling for applications from academics, NHS employees or companies that have therapeutics that could be repurposed or repositioned for use in COVID-19 patients. The primary purpose is to accelerate availability of treatments for patients and it is therefore expected that applicants will already have material available for testing and a plan for rapid scale up of clinical material. Priority will be given to projects that have a clear path and availability for patients in a 6-12 month timeframe. Plans for the structure of the clinical trials should be in advanced stages of development and should follow the specialist guidance from the regulators on COVID-19 trials.

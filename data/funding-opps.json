The central theme of submitted projects must be the quantitative or computational understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics. The intent is discovery of principles of infectious disease transmission and testing mathematical or computational models that elucidate infectious disease systems. Projects should be broad, interdisciplinary efforts that go beyond the scope of typical studies. They should focus on the determinants and interactions of transmission among humans, non-human animals, and/or plants. This includes, for example, the spread of pathogens; the influence of environmental factors such as climate; the population dynamics and genetics of reservoir species or hosts; the feedback between ecological transmission and evolutionary dynamics; and the cultural, social, behavioral, and economic dimensions of pathogen transmission. Research may be on zoonotic, environmentally-borne, vector-borne, or enteric pathogens of either terrestrial or aquatic systems and organisms, including diseases of animals and plants, at any scale from specific pathogens to inclusive environmental systems. Proposals for research on disease systems of public health concern to developing countries are strongly encouraged, as are disease systems of concern in agricultural systems. Investigators are encouraged to develop the appropriate multidisciplinary team, including for example, anthropologists, modelers, ecologists, bioinformaticians, genomics researchers, social scientists, economists, oceanographers, mathematical scientists, epidemiologists, evolutionary biologists, entomologists, parasitologists, microbiologists, bacteriologists, virologists, pathologists or veterinarians, with the goal of integrating knowledge across disciplines to enhance our ability to predict and control infectious diseases. The goal of the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) program is to support important and innovative research on the ecological, evolutionary, and socio-ecological principles that influence the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. The program's focus is on the discovery of general principles and processes and on building and testing models that elucidate these principles. Projects must address the quantitative or computational understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics. Research in EEID is expected to be an interdisciplinary effort that goes beyond the scope of typical studies funded by the standing programs of the partner agencies. Projects should bring together such areas as anthropology, bioinformatics, computational science, ecology, economics, epidemiology, evolution, food science, genomics, geography, global health, mathematics, medicine, microbiology, oceanography, plant science, population biology, sociology, physical environmental sciences, systems science, and veterinary medicine. Research within EEID is expected to generate rigorously characterized and tested models that are of value to the scientific community, but also may be useful in decision making. The history of the EEID program has shown that the most competitive proposals are those that advance broad, conceptual knowledge that reaches beyond the specific system under study and that may be useful for understanding public, agricultural or ecosystem health, natural resource use and wildlife management, and/or economic development. Such proposals are typically interdisciplinary in their approach and/or the nature of the question(s) being addressed.","updateddate":"6/30/2020"},{"title":"Dear Colleague Letter: Request for SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposals Addressing COVID-19","agency":"Directorate for Engineering/NSF","logo":"assets//logos//nsf.png","category":"NSF","dueDate":"Continuous Submission","fundingLevel":"Not Specified","website":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20065/nsf20065.jsp","description":"The Division of Innovation and Industrial Partnerships (IIP) of the Engineering Directorate invites US-based small businesses to submit Phase I proposals focused on the development and deployment of new technologies, products, processes, and services with the potential to positively impact the nation’s and world’s ability to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.

Though the germ theory of disease would not be formulated until the 1860s, the English public engaged in “social distancing” behaviors to avoid illness (Washington Post, 2020), leading to the closure of universities. Among the displaced was a young Isaac Newton, still a student at Trinity College in Cambridge. During the ensuing year of isolated study and reflection, Newton developed the basis for calculus, as well as foundational theories in gravitation, motion, and optics.\r\n\r\nSeparated from the Great Plague by 350 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to similar health responses among the general public and scientific community, forcing the closure of laboratories and universities throughout the world and slowing scientific progress across theoretical and empirical domains.

The National Biodefense Strategy is.the nation’s plan for ensuring that the country is prepared for, responding to, and recovering from health incidents such as these. As a partner in the Strategy, the Department of Energy (DOE) contributes science and technology to support these efforts. This is not the first emerging infectious disease event that the world will face, nor will it be the last I am asking for your ideas about how DOE and the National Labs might contribute resources to help address COVID-19 through science and technology efforts and collaborations. Through its user facilities, computational power, and enabling infrastructure, DOE has unique capabilities that the scientific community may leverage for the COVID-19 response and recovery. DOE does not provide medical and clinical work; instead, the Department’s mission complements the efforts of the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and other Federal partners by helping to understand the scientific phenomena contributing to COVID-19, from the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease, to models that can mimic its spread. DOE supports significant biologically focused facilities and resources, including the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC), Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory (EMSL), and DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase ). These and other DOE resources may be used for many studies, such as: Developing high-throughput multiplex technologies to characterize virus-host interactions, determine phage resistance mechanisms in nature, identify the degree of specificity for each bacterial resistance mechanisms across diverse phage types, and understand the coevolution of hosts and their phages, which can ultimately be used to design better phage therapeutic treatments and tools for precision microbiome engmeenng; Improved modeling for understanding natural viral populations and persistence in the environment, as well as predictive modeling for viral stability and evolution in changing environmental conditions; Understanding virus-microbiome community composition, function, and evolution; Synthetic biology of key target viral proteins to rapidly develop improved vaccines or therapeutics; and • Synthetic biology to construct viral genome variants and test viral stability, persistence, and resilience in the environment. Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) at the DOE National Labs can provide high resolution molecular structure of virus particles and their interactions with other macromolecules including antibodies and drug candidates at cryogenic temperatures. These instruments provide another window to characterize viruses and provide insights on treatment paths. Protein characterization at DOE’s light sources and neutron sources can yield key insights into the relationship between structure and function of the proteins comprising viruses. Macromolecular crystallography (MX) provides the positions to atomic resolution of a protein’s atoms, as well as the atoms of a bound drug or drug fragment that has been infused into the protein crystal for screening potential pharmaceuticals. This critical information can guide development of a potent drug with minimal side effects. MX can also provide the evolution of structures with time to understand drug binding or metabolism. X-ray solution scattering can provide rapid screening of drug fragment libraries to detect binding to proteins. Fragments that bind and cause protein conformational change are targets for further investigated at high resolution with MX. DOE’s user facilities also have special capabilities for characterization of small (nanometers in size) crystals. The Nanoscale Science Research Centers, located at five of the National Laboratories, could be valuable resources for developing intrinsically antiviral surfaces and materials for COVID-19 and other viruses. Supercomputing facilities at DOE offer some of the most powerful resources for scientific computing in the world. The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), and National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) may be used for modeling and simulation coupled with machine and deep learning techniques to study a range of areas, including examining underlying protein structure, classifying the evolution of the virus, understanding mutation, uncovering important differences and similarities with the 2002-2003 SARS virus, searching for potential vaccine and antiviral compounds, and simulating the spread of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of countermeasure options. The Department encourages you to consider scientific questions that underpin COVID-19 response and that the research community may answer using DOE user facilities, computational resources, and enabling infrastructure. Responses will be reviewed beginning March 18, 2020. The Department is acting rapidly to leverage, and when appropriate provide prioritized access to, the full range of DOE user facilities and other facilities available at national laboratories to support the national and international effort to address COVID-19.","updateddate":"6/30/2020"},{"title":"RFP -- VA Amarillo Cepheid COVID-19 Test Kits -State Mandate Tests increase funding for OY3 and OY4","agency":"Department of Veterans Affairs","logo":"assets//logos//dod.png","category":"Federal - Others","subCategory":"Federal - All DoD","dueDate":"Continuous Submission","fundingLevel":"Not Specified","website":"https://beta.sam.gov/opp/9f2c7d1a30dd4610b1a6bdf7a2b788da/view","description":"THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

Currently, suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in our nation. The current national COVID-19 crisis will certainly contribute to the growth in the number of Americans needing urgent care to address mental health needs, including suicidality. Americans across the country will struggle with increases in depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, isolation, loss of employment, financial instability and other challenges, which can lead to suicide and suicide attempts. The purpose of this program is to support states and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic in advancing efforts to prevent suicide and suicide attempts among adults age 25 and older in order to reduce the overall suicide rate and number of suicides in the U.S. SAMHSA recognizes the serious concerns for domestic violence victims that are posed by mass stay-at-home and quarantine orders. Under normal circumstances, domestic  violence can lead to situations of increased stress, anxiety, depression and trauma. These are all contributing factors to risk for suicide if unaddressed. Current conditions exacerbate this situation for domestic violence victims. Given the unique situation for these particular individuals, SAMHSA is requiring that a minimum of 25 percent of direct services funding be used to support this population.

This includes, for example, the investigation of the challenges and effects of an epidemic or pandemic and of measures taken for healthcare systems; psychological, social and cultural factors in the emergence, spread and treatment of epidemics and pandemics and the legal and ethical implications; the impacts on global and regional economic development, production and value creation chains, logistics, transport and communication; fundamental biological and medical aspects of a pathogen and the associated symptoms, as well as therapeutic methods or preventive measures in combination with one or more of the above topic areas. The call is primarily aimed at multidisciplinary research projects. Proposals will also be considered for projects designed to gather and record basic data on the current epidemic and current countermeasures, which can serve as the basis for future retrospective analyses. Projects involving the simulation of the spread and consequences of pandemics and the effectiveness of interventions may also be submitted.","updateddate":"6/30/2020"},{"title":"Medical Research Future Fund – Coronavirus Research Response – 2020 COVID-19 Mental Health Research Grant Opportunity","agency":"National Health and Medical Research Council","logo":"assets//logos//nhmrc.png","category":"International","dueDate":"6/31/2020","fundingLevel":"690,000 USD","website":"https://www.grants.gov.au/?event=public.GO.show&GOUUID=A25B83FA-06E4-20E4-E4565F9DED9DE54B","description":"The Medical Research Future Fund Emerging Priorities and Consumer Driven Research (EPCDR) Initiative aims to enable or support:\r\n\r\nhigh quality biomedical, clinical, health services and/or population health research that improves patient care\r\ntranslation of new discoveries into clinical practice\r\nnew diagnoses, treatments and cures to those suffering from rare and debilitating conditions\r\njoint collaboration of consumers and researchers in undertaking research in emerging priority areas, and\r\nmany Australians with debilitating conditions.\r\nThis Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) Coronavirus Research Response grant opportunity will support research to understand how the mental health system can be enhanced to be most effective and responsive during and following the acute COVID-19 crisis.

It is anticipated that applications will be for funding to repurpose one or more drugs that are generic, already licensed, or are in late stage development for another indication. COVID-19 now represents a global emergency. Development and testing of a vaccine will take at least a year and it may be two years before there is good protection across the most vulnerable groups. There is a clear need for new treatments that will reduce the mortality rate while we wait for a vaccine. Development of novel molecules is not thought to be realistic in the timeframe needed to impact upon this pandemic, so the focus for this call is on repurposing already available drugs (including biologics) or those in late stages of development. LifeArc is calling for applications from academics, NHS employees or companies that have therapeutics that could be repurposed or repositioned for use in COVID-19 patients. The primary purpose is to accelerate availability of treatments for patients and it is therefore expected that applicants will already have material available for testing and a plan for rapid scale up of clinical material. Priority will be given to projects that have a clear path and availability for patients in a 6-12 month timeframe. Plans for the structure of the clinical trials should be in advanced stages of development and should follow the specialist guidance from the regulators on COVID-19 trials.

The evidence from multiple countries at the epicenter of the pandemic clearly shows that people living with NCDs (PLWNCDs) are more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 and are also at substantially higher risk of becoming severely ill or dying from the virus. Seventy-one percent of all deaths worldwide are attributable to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and other chronic conditions collectively known as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).\r\n\r\nThe burden of NCDs is evident across high-, middle-, and low-income countries. However, there are distinct differences among regions, which suggests the need for targeted intervention strategies.

Do the effects differ by race/ethnicity or by measures of socioeconomic status? This RFA responds specifically to the unique situation created by the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. Closing of non-essential businesses in many locations has led to reduced emissions of air pollutants from the energy sector and other industries, as well as significantly reduced traffic volume due to stay-at-home policies. As of spring 2020, various research efforts are underway to study the intersection of air pollution and coronavirus. There are many questions that require careful evaluation, in particular because the context within which we study the linkages between air pollution and health have changed due to COVID-19 (including emission sources; changes in behavior that affect exposures (for example people spending more time indoors; health care access and utilization, etc), which may act in opposite directions; the extent to which these changes will persist is not clear.

The SOM Office of Research will support these important efforts by our investigators by investing in projects that constitute critical research activity on COVID-19 and that have already received approval from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research. The intent is to fund 3-4 projects to accelerate knowledge to address the urgency of need in this critical area. Projects can include but are not limited to basic science, clinical research, population health research, data science, and epidemiology. Data from the funded projects should facilitate new NIH or other funding as it becomes available.","updateddate":"6/30/2020"},{"title":"Children, Screens and COVID-19 (Temporarily Suspended)","agency":"Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development","logo":"assets//logos//children-and-screens-logo-brightest-1.png","category":"Others","dueDate":"None Posted","fundingLevel":"100,000 USD","website":"https://www.childrenandscreens.com/grants/","description":"The COVID pandemic and the attendant shelter in place orders throughout the United States have made screens play an even more central role in families’ lives.

This $100K challenge grant is intended to leverage and augment existing cohort studies.  Never has the mission of Children and Screens—to help children lead healthy lives in a digital world—been more important. The COVID pandemic and the attendant shelter in place orders throughout the United States have made screens play an even more central role in families’ lives. \r\n\r\nChildren and Screens is interested in studies that assess the positive and negative impact of this dramatic shift. For example, during the pandemic screens are relied upon for distance learning and are the sole means of maintaining social connections. How well are they performing in this regard? What approaches have proven effective and for which populations? Conversely, relaxed limits on screens may increase the prevalence of compulsive use, anxiety, depression and other untoward effects previously attributed to digital media. Furthermore, distracted parenting may have dramatically increased as parents try to work from home and provide childcare simultaneously which may impede both the quantity and the quality of parent child interactions.

We may experience delivery delays due to non-essential businesses being impacted along the supply chain by Federal and State actions taken to stem the spread of COVID-19. "},{"questionType":"Sponsored Programs Administration \r\n(Pre and Post Award)","question":"Can COVID-19 related travel cancellations be charged to sponsored awards?","answer":"NIH addresses this in NOT-OD-20-086. For NIH awards, non-refundable travel and related fees may be charged to the NIH award if they would have otherwise been allowable (e.g. necessary to accomplish program objectives). Additionally, OMB has released M-20-17, “Administrative Relief for Recipients and Applicants of Federal Financial Assistance Directly Impacted by the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) due to Loss of Operations” which addresses allowability of costs not normally charged to awards.  \r\nNSF has not issued specific guidance on this but will allow the cancellation fees if the treatment of the costs is consistent with the university policy for all funding sources. \r\nOther sponsored agencies have not addressed cancellation expenses. At the current time we recommend that these fees be charged to awards. If agencies issue alternative guidance, these expenses will need to be removed.  \r\nUnits should retain documentation relating to the cancellation costs charged to a grant in accordance with record retention requirements. "},{"questionType":"Sponsored Programs Administration \r\n(Pre and Post Award)","question":"I purchased airfare on a grant for a conference, and the conference was  cancelled due to COVID-19. The airline offered a credit for future travel. Can the cost of the airfare and any associated fees be charged to the grant? ","answer":"The credit should be tracked to ensure it’s used to directly benefit the same grant that incurred the cost. \r\nIf you plan to use the credit for other travel in support of other research then the charge should be transferred the appropriate funding source to align the airfare cost with the benefit. \r\nIf the credit is never utilized the amount of the original airfare should be written off to nonsponsored funds. "},{"questionType":"Sponsored Programs Administration \r\n(Pre and Post Award)","question":"I was planning a sponsor funded conference and now presenters and conference attendees can no longer travel to the conference location. Are cancelation costs chargeable to the grant?","answer":"The first step is to contact the hotel or event venue you have contracted with and see what flexibility they will provide and what are the penalties for canceling or postponement. \r\r\nIf you need assistance in working with the hotel, reach out to your purchasing agent found in the department assignments page of albany.edu/spa. \r\r\nIf you want to charge the cancellation fees to the grant, the PI and departmental staff should work with your Research Administrator to coordinate outreach to sponsoring agencies. Please keep any relevant written documentation of the guidance received.  "},{"questionType":"Sponsored Programs Administration \r\n(Pre and Post Award)","question":"I purchased refundable airfare for future travel. Can the refundable airfare be charged to a grant? ","answer":"Yes. Refundable airfare purchased during the COVID-19 Outbreak may be charged to a grant provided we document the cost benefit. This DOES NOT include trip insurance. Trip insurance is not chargeable to sponsored awards. "},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Human Subjects Studies (IRB)","question":"Will my Human Subjects study requests be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) during the COVID-19 outbreak?

NOTE ALSO - these studies will be given review priority. "},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Human Subjects Studies (IRB)","question":"Can I continue conducting existing/active study already reviewed and approved by the IRB?","answer":"Yes.  But, research studies involving face-to-face (F2F) interaction and/or sharing of materials with participants must be paused until further notice, effective immediately. This pause will continue, minimally, until in-person classes resume. In some cases, researchers may be able to utilize alternatives to face-to-face contact. The IRB is currently prioritizing amendments/modifications to active protocols to add study procedures to serve as alternatives to in-person recruitment and data collection (e.g., phone, Zoom conferencing, Qualtrics surveys, etc.)."},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Human Subjects Studies (IRB)","question":"Which human subjects studies may continue?","answer":"Studies that do not involve face-to-face interactions with participants.  Studies conducted electronically or via telephone or involving secondary data analysis may continue.\r\n"},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Human Subjects Studies (IRB)","question":"Do we need approval from the IRB for communications to study subjects explaining the pause in activities?","answer":"No.  It is not necessary to submit a modification to make these communications with participants."},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Human Subjects Studies (IRB)","question":"Is an amendment/modification request necessary to change the mode of data collection for my EXEMPT study (i.e., study protocol number contains an \"X\", such as \"19-X-1000\")?

Do we need to halt these activities?","answer":"Yes -- Activities involving the collection of human biological samples at the UA campus activities are halted.   NOTE, HOWEVER, If the activities are conducted off-site (i.e., under the oversight of external organizations such as clinics, hospitals, etc.) they should be informed of the university's pause, but they would make and independent decision as to whether to proceed with the research activities at their site. "},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Human Subjects Studies (IRB)","question":"How will the F2F pause impact studies outside of a UA setting at international settings?","answer":"For projects where an international collaborator is responsible for the direct interaction/intervention with participants, or where UA and international researchers are conducting such interactions together, the local COVID-19 situation must be considered. The study team should seek guidance from the local IRB or ethics review board regarding the continuation of the research and share this information with the UA IRB. In areas with high-risk for COVID-19, projects involving person-to-person contact should be paused or use modified procedures to eliminate the need for person-to-person contact. Investigators must monitor the changing COVID-19 situation.  For projects where UA researchers are already in country and actively involved in face-to-face subject interactions independently, the research must be paused and procedures modified to eliminate direct interactions, unless the investigator can demonstrate that the research is being conducted in an area of low risk for COVID-19. Investigators must monitor the changing COVID-19 situation. \r\n"},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Human Subjects Studies (IRB)","question":"If I am pausing study procedures on a project reviewed by an external IRB of Record, must I notify that IRB?","answer":"Yes, as soon as feasible, for their awareness.

"},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Animals use in Research and Teaching (IACUC and LAR)","question":"What can I do now to prepare for the possibility that the COVID-19 situation disrupts my animal experiments?","answer":"• Effective immediately, no additional studies/experiments may begin. That is, no procedures may be performed on naïve animals so that we may minimize the number of animals requiring daily care (Note that IACUC approval processes remain intact for protocol changes and reviews).   \r\n• Orders for acquiring additional animals are no longer being accepted. LAR will be canceling all pending animal orders.  Shipments from vendors or other collaborating institutions will also be cancelled unless cancellation will negatively impact animal welfare; e.g., incoming animal shipments already in process will still be received.  \r\n• Breeding of species/strains that are commercially available must cease, and no new commercially available breeding pairs should be established.  \r\n• Postpone any elective activities or experiments that are not time sensitive in the event that you, or a member of your laboratory staff, are no longer able to complete the study and/or continue collecting data without interruption. \r\n• You should plan for what might be more significant restrictions in the days and weeks ahead.   Immediately prioritize staff time to prepare your continuity plans to be fully actionable on short notice and for your lab staff to be familiar with them. Identify up to 20 percent of animals assigned to your protocol(s) that you consider most critical to save (“high-priority preserve”) in the highly unlikely event that circumstances require selective depopulation. Any requests beyond that threshold must be approved by the LAR Facilities Manager, in consultation with an IACUC Subcommittee. Identify 2-3 key individuals that can manage essential procedures (those that, if discontinued, would generate significant financial, data or animal loss). These individuals should be deemed “critical” so that they may continue to have access to the appropriate animal care facilities in the event of an emergency reduction in operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Animals use in Research and Teaching (IACUC and LAR)","question":"How do I identify my critical/high-priority (20%) preserve animals at the cage level?","answer":"•To identify critical/high-priority animals at the cage level, use a sharpie marker and write the word “SAVE” on the cage card. The “SAVE” should be 1-2” in height so that it’s clear and easily identified by LAR staff. LAR staff are prepared to assist you in clearly identifying cages. Please contact the Lab Animal Facilities Manager, Tim Quinn at Tquinn@albany.edu or LAR@albany.edu for additional assistance. Please remember that the process of identifying animals now is done to help the university plan for a variety of scenarios. \r\n"},{"questionType":"Regulatory and Research Compliance - Animals use in Research and Teaching (IACUC and LAR)","question":"What are the best methods for us to reduce our animal breeding colonies?","answer":"If you are suspending breeding of commercially-available animals, try to conserve the fewest number of animals needed to maintain the strain or line.

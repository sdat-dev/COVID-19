                    Guidance to Research Community 
                </h1>
                <p>
                 As the COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges to all facets of society, including research institutions like ours, we are sharing the below guidance to help you manage your research projects, laboratories and scholarly activities. You should know that the Division for Research stands ready to assist you in any way we can, whether with pre- or post-award management, or with further contingency planning, should you need assistance or support.  To this end, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly or to the staff within the Division for Research.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    As government officials continue to work through this dynamic situation, the University at Albany, in collaboration with the State University of New York, the Research Foundation for SUNY (RF-SUNY) and campuses system-wide, is working to develop guidance in support of the continuing operation of our institution’s research activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our current research guidance and resources are as follows:
                </p>
                <p class = "list-preceding-paragraph more-text">
                <b class = "purple-font">INITIAL CAMPUS RESEARCH GUIDANCE:</b><br>
                Consistent with the Governor’s recent executive orders and campus notifications, we are recommending the following:
                <br>
                </p>
                <ul class = "more-text">
                <li><b>Stay at home and adhere to social distancing guidelines:</b> Principal investigators, laboratory personnel, as well as faculty scholars across the arts, humanities, and social sciences, should when at all possible work from home on all activities that can be accomplished remotely. Research teams/groups are encouraged to establish systems of remote communication to remain in regular contact with one another, such as through Zoom or Skype. </li>
                <li><b>Research spaces and laboratories may remain open at the PI/faculty scholar’s discretion; However, strict adherence to social distancing guidance is required:</b> Research activities and laboratories do not need to completely shut down at this time, subject to strict adherence to social distancing guidelines and potential future policy changes at the direction of the government and the University. As appropriate, research personnel will be allowed into a research space or laboratory in order to address required tasks/activities which the principal investigator/researcher believes can only be achieved on-site. Principal investigators should arrange for these visits to be conducted in a manner that substantially minimizes person-to-person interaction (e.g. staggering schedules). Any member of a research team/group who is sick should not come to work under any circumstance.  Please be advised that undergraduate students are encouraged to stay-at-home and should be afforded alternate non-laboratory work assignments and virtual/online opportunities to participate 
                    in research related meetings to fulfill their for-credit undergraduate 
                    research requirements.</li>
                <li><b>Interaction with outside vendors/parties subject to strict adherence to social distancing guidance:</b> Principal investigators should be in contact with outside vendors/parties to modify delivery schedules in order to minimize social interaction, and in a manner consistent with the government and University’s most recent direction.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class = "purple-font list-preceding-paragraph more-text"><b>WEB RESOURCES:</b></p>
                <ul class = "more-text">
                <li>Please visit our COVID-19 research guidance and resources webpage, which provides links to important resources to reference during the COVID-19 outbreak. Here you will find guidance from the University at Albany, SUNY, RF-SUNY (including pre- and post-award guidance), federal sponsors and agencies, resources and tools (e.g., laboratory shut down checklist), as well as points of contact in the Division for Research and the Colleges and Schools.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, should you have any questions regarding your sponsored program(s), please email <a class = "email-link" href = "mailto:spa@albany.edu">spa@albany.edu</a>. Should you have specific questions regarding an award or a proposal, please contact your Research/Grants Administrator. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class = "purple-font list-preceding-paragraph more-text"><b>RESEARCH DISCUSSION:</b></p>
<ul class = "more-text">
<li>
We will be scheduling an online conversation with the college and schools’ Associate Deans for Research (or a Dean’s delegate) and center/lab directors to discuss the current state of research on campus in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our goal is to provide a dialogue to address current and emerging issues and the interruption or disruption impacting our research enterprise. If you should have any questions in advance of this conversation, please direct your question(s) to <a class = "email-link" href= "mailto:research@albany.edu">research@albany.edu</a>.   
</li>
</ul>
<p class = "purple-font list-preceding-paragraph more-text"><b>RESEARCH PLANNING & PREPAREDNESS:</b></p>
  <ul class = "more-text">
<li>All faculty, researchers, center and lab directors are encouraged to develop a research continuity plan as soon as possible. Recognizing the adverse future impacts of COVID-19, which may significantly slow the work of your research/lab team(s), it is important that you begin to take the steps necessary to address potential delays you may experience in the weeks and months ahead. The planning you undertake now will go far to support the long-term success of your research and our larger research enterprise as a whole. </li>
 </ul>
<p class ="more-text">Please be advised that COVID-19 guidance for researchers, labs and centers remains fluid and will be updated as conditions change and additional direction and information becomes available.  
</p>
<p class = "more-text">
Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate this unprecedented situation together. We look forward to being in touch with you in the days ahead to share new information and further this important discussion.
